    "text": "Hitman: Codename 47 is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive exclusively for Microsoft Windows in November 2000, and the first entry in the series. In the game, players control Agent 47 , a genetically enhanced human clone who is rigorously trained in methods of murder. Upon escaping from his testing facility, 47 is hired by the International Contract Agency (ICA), a global contract killing organization. His missions take him to locations in Asia , Europe , and South America to assassinate wealthy and decadent criminals, at first seeming to share no connections with each other (beyond passing mentions to the service of each in the French Foreign Legion ), but who are soon revealed to have all played a role in a larger conspiracy. The gameplay revolves around finding ways to stealthily reach and eliminate each target; to this end, players can make use of various tools, including disguises and suppressed weaponry. However, some levels are more action-focused and do not feature stealth as a possibility, instead playing like a traditional third-person shooter .",

It sold over 500,000 units by 2009. The game went on to launch the Hitman video game franchise, beginning with the first sequel, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin , in 2002.",

    "text": "Hitman: Codename 47 is presented from the third-person perspective , but the control setup is similar to a first-person shooter as 47's movements are restricted to turning, strafing and moving forward and backward. Each level takes place in a semi- open world environment which is populated with non-player characters such as civilians and armed guards. Although mission criteria may vary, the goal is generally to find 47's assigned target and kill them by any means possible. Though the path may appear linear, it is possible through various ways to accomplish the mission and approach a target directly without eliciting a violent reprisal. The game essentially emphasises stealth and silent kills without raising alerts, giving the player a higher financial reward for doing so. Penalties in the form of financial deductions are given, for example if the player kills civilians, but none of the guards or other enemies are slain. As the money is used to purchase weapons and ammo during the course of the game, this pressures the player to utilise stealth, disguise, and melee based mechanics for the most cost-effective method to take out targets.",

    "text": "The player can peek around corners by using the lean function, which prompts 47 to tilt slightly to one side. 47 is able to climb ladders, but cannot defend himself with a weapon while doing so. In addition, he is only able to jump from one balcony to another. There is an on-screen cursor to indicate in which direction 47 will attack. The heads-up display includes a life bar which measures 47's health, ammo capacity, kevlar durability, and the current item selected. Alert messages sometimes appear next to the health readout. These occur whenever enemies discover a body on the map, or if 47 falls under suspicion. 47's weaponry consists of various short and long-range firearms, a garrote wire, and a knife. Handguns generally have excellent range, while automatic rifles and machine guns decrease in accuracy the farther away 47 is from his target. 47 can also equip himself with a sniper rifle , including one concealed in a special suitcase, which must be reassembled before he may use it. Once he is finished with the rifle, 47 can take it apart and place it in the suitcase once more.",

    "text": "Disguise plays a large role in gameplay. Any time a male non-player character is killed – aside from targets and some unique characters – 47 may take their clothes and impersonate them. This is necessary to access restricted areas where only guards may enter. At the start of each level, 47 begins in a default costume. This costume is his trademark suit and red tie which is folded and left on the ground whenever 47 changes clothes. The player may replace 47's outfit with a previous one by simply approaching them and selecting the option to change. If anyone on the map spots a body lying on the ground, it will create unwanted attention for 47, such as base alarms, calls for back-up, and reports to their boss, usually the target. In the event that 47 adopted the clothes of someone he has slain, his disguise will be compromised as soon as the body is discovered. 47 creates sound while walking which will alert any hostile characters in the facility. To move without being detected, the player can use the sneak function, which causes 47 to crouch and move in a stalking manner. Sneaking also allows 47 to retrieve a weapon from his inventory without anyone hearing it; if 47 is standing upright when the player pulls out a weapon, it will alert nearby characters. Characters who are dead may be dragged at any time. When dragging, 47 lifts up the closest available leg or arm and begins to hoist it away as movement is directed by the player. Naturally, being spotting dragging a dead body also garners unwanted attention.",

A year later, 47 has joined the International Contract Agency (ICA) – a global organization that specializes in performing assassinations for various clients – and has been assigned the identity of \"Agent 47\" and a handler, Diana Burnwood.

As Romanian special forces raid the building, 47 eliminates the target, whom he recognizes as Ort-Meyer's assistant, and discovers the truth of his existence: he is the product of a cloning experiment that combined the DNA of Ort-Meyer, Hong, Ochoa, Fuchs, and Jegorov to create the perfect assassin.",

Ort-Meyer then reveals that he has since created more skilled and easier to control clones, dubbed \"Subjects 48\", and dispatches them to kill 47. After killing all the clones with his superior training, 47 poses as one of them to reach Ort-Meyer, shooting him when the latter realizes the deception. Before dying, Ort-Meyer regrets that he was unable to recognize \"his own son\" and accepts his death at 47's hands, who proceeds to snap his neck.",

Early on, the team conceptualised a fantasy massively multiplayer online game (MMO) entitled Rex Dominus ; however, Danish film studio Nordisk Film , which IO Interactive was partnered with at the time, asked the team to cease production on Rex Dominus and \"test [themselves]\" by developing a \"simple shooter\" instead. As such, the team opted for a run-and-gun action game , as it took less time to develop compared to an MMO, drawing inspiration from John Woo films, such as Hard Boiled and The Killer . They turned to develop for personal computers (PCs), because they were unable to acquire development kits for consoles , and had also found interest in the steady increase of PCs' 3D graphics capabilities.",

[...] Standard 'death animations' just looked too static so some of the coders tried to see if they could use real-time inverse kinematics for the falling bodies. The first versions ran terribly slowly until one of the programmers figured out a way to fake the whole calculation.\" This led to the first use of advanced ragdoll physics in a video game. This physics system caught the eyes of British publisher Eidos Interactive , and especially staff member Jonas Eneroth , who thought that the system could greatly benefit Codename 47 ' s gameplay. Following six months of negotiations, a publishing deal was signed between IO Interactive and Eidos Interactive. Eneroth became executive producer on the project.",

On each level, the main character, a contract killer named Agent 47 , is given a set of objectives to complete. Most levels require the assassination of one or more people. The way through which the missions are to be completed is up to the player, and there are often a variety of ways to complete missions. Instead of taking an action-oriented, aggressive approach, one can also set traps, like poisoning a drink, to terminate the target in silence. Some missions have assassination possibilities unique to the level.",

This plays in with the \"suspicion\" system; a bar beside the health meter on the HUD represents how much suspicion the player garners. There are multiple ways to blend in more effectively; for example, the player can make sure to carry an AK-47 assault rifle while disguised as a Russian soldier . Despite the usage of a uniform, being too near to fellow guards will increase the suspicion as they would have an opportunity to more closely examine Agent 47. Running, climbing and being in restricted places are other ways to garner concern.",

The game rewards the player for critical thinking and problem solving, encouraging the player not to treat the game as a simple shooter. Achieving \"Silent Assassin\" status on multiple missions rewards the player with bonus weapons. These weapons, plus items found in previous levels, can be carried over into future ones, allowing for differing means of accomplishing the tasks. Big weapons like rifles and shotguns cannot be concealed, thus the player has to either be wearing an appropriate disguise to match the weapon, or make sure no one sees the player use it.",

In addition, he learns that all the targets were connected to the sale of a nuclear warhead to Sergei, who needed them eliminated in order to conceal the fact that he intended to arm the warheads to missiles that possessed software which would disguise them as American-made, therefore bypassing the American missile defense system, and sell them to interested parties. 47 pursues Sergei, who has taken Vittorio back to his church, and kills him and his men. Concerned for his soul, Vittorio begs 47 to renounce his path of violence and lead a good life, handing him his rosary .

    "text": "Hitman: Contracts Original Soundtrack was composed by Jesper Kyd and released in 2004. The score features the same Latin choral arrangements as in all the other scores; however, they are heavily sampled and mixed into the dark electronic soundscape. As summed up by Kyd, \"First of all it is a much darker score. Hitman 2 was an epic story that kind of spanned all over the world. This one, although there are different locations, it's not one big epic story. It's a lot of darker, psychological small stories mixed together, so the score follows the darker aspect of Hitman and his career.\" The score was awarded the title of \"Best Original Music\" at the 2005 BAFTA Games Awards .",

Air Hendrix of GamePro said of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions, \"In this captivating outing, 47 revisits the past while modernizing the nagging flaws of his previous games, making for his best trail of assassinations yet.\"",

The score was performed with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra and the Hungarian Radio Choir. It features Kyd's trademark ambience and dark, foreboding arrangements with the choral parts in deep brooding Latin .

Even though \"it's not as thematic as the first of the Hitman games, there is enough material here that will satisfy most soundtrack collectors\". Despite the orchestral focus, \"there are plenty of rhythms and beats that accompany the orchestral palette\", such as \"Club Heaven\" that \"features some pretty standard 'nightclub' techno \". However, Scheller states that a lot of tracks are, \"at times, wall-to-wall music\" that accompany Agent 47 during various stages; but sums up that \"I find that the more I listen to the album, the more enjoyable it becomes\".",

Presented from a third-person perspective , the gameplay centers around completing a number of objectives within a series of levels . Objectives range from reaching the end of a level to eliminating specific individuals. The player chooses how to complete each mission and is able to take multiple paths to reach targets and locations. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault or sniper rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipes against enemies if opting for action-oriented approaches, or avoid adversaries altogether by using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking specific targets using a stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has an 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, pull a switch to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull levers to make scaffolding to fall down, instigate small or large fires, or even set off fireworks. Players must complete a number of chapters in order to progress through the story. The player journeys to a wide variety of locations, including a mansion, library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and hotel before the finishing the game.",

Pursued by police, 47 evades an extensive police presence by escaping through an abandoned library into a hippie commune and then out through the Chicago subway network. 47 then kills one of Dexter's informants, a mobster named Dom Osmond (Jon Curry), at his strip club . 47 discovers that Dexter has hired a group of mercenaries led by Edward Wade ( Larry Cedar ) to ensure the capture of Victoria. Wade subsequently dispatches Bill Dole (Nicolas Roye), Larry Clay (James Sie), and Frank Owens (Jeffrey Johnson) to capture Birdie and find Victoria. Though 47 successfully kills Dole, Clay and Owens during a Chinese New Year celebration, Birdie is caught by Sanchez and trades Victoria's location for his life. 47 rushes back to the Orphanage and eliminates Wade and his assault team. However, Dexter's son Lenny (Shane Stevens), managing to be in the right place at the right time, grabs Victoria and escapes.",

From there, 47 moves onto the town of Hope, South Dakota, unaware that Birdie has also contacted the ICA and Detective Cosmo Faulkner ( Jonathan Adams ) of the Chicago PD , culminating in several attempts to kill 47 by the Agency throughout the remainder of the game. Despite the town being firmly under Dexter Industries' control, 47 is able to covertly kill the entirety of Lenny's gang, the Hope Cougars. In doing so, 47 disrupts the gangs plan to sell Victoria to a rival weapons corporation for a significant payout. 47 then kidnaps Lenny and interrogates him in the desert , before either killing or abandoning him. 47 then continues on to a Dexter Industries' facility, infiltrating its laboratory and eliminating key leadership within the science division tasked with examining Victoria, and destroys their research. 47 also discovers an unlicensed mixed martial arts bout taking place on site at which he is able to kill Sanchez.",

Certain plot details for the game were rumored in 2009, stating that the game's story would lead Agent 47 to a low point from which he would have to rebuild himself. On 20 April 2011, Square Enix filed the trademark for the name Hitman: Absolution in Europe, leading sites to speculate that it would be the name of the fifth Hitman game. On 6 May 2011, a teaser trailer was released, confirming the title Hitman: Absolution . The trailer briefly showed Agent 47 attaching a suppressor and a rattlesnake coiled around his signature Silverballer pistol. It has been reported the game will be a \"familiar and yet significantly different experience from other Hitman games.\" On 9 October 2011, a full gameplay trailer entitled \"Run for Your Life\" was released.",

The single-player story follows genetically engineered assassin Agent 47 as he goes on a worldwide adventure and solves a mysterious series of seemingly unconnected assassinations. Hitman features a number of large, open-ended sandboxes that Agent 47 can freely explore. The game presents the player with various assassination opportunities, many of which are unconventional.

Square Enix Europe set up a Montréal studio to work on the next Hitman game, but IO Interactive returned to lead the game's development following the under-performance of Absolution . The title was conceived as a reimagining of the franchise as the team attempted to integrate the gameplay of Absolution with the open-endedness of earlier installments of the series. According to the team, Hitman is a puzzle game with action and stealth elements; the developers refined the simulation and artificial intelligence of each level. The game adopted an episodic model and the team envisioned the game as a service . It was marketed as a \"World of Assassination\" and provided a platform that would expand and evolve over time, and inspire a trilogy of games.",

Upon release, it received positive reviews; critics praised the game's episodic release format, locations, level design, and its replayability but criticised the always-online requirement and excessive handholding. The game underperformed commercially and caused publisher Square Enix to divest from IO Interactive in May 2017. Following a management buyout , IO retained the rights to the series and partnered with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment to produce a sequel titled Hitman 2 , which was released in November 2018. The World of Assassination trilogy concluded with Hitman 3 , released in January 2021. In January 2023, Hitman was delisted from sales after IO Interactive rebranded Hitman 3 as Hitman: World of Assassination , with the contents of the previous two Hitman games becoming available to Hitman 3 owners, free of charge.",

He can use his specially equipped garrote wire to strangle his victims or disguise his killings as accidental deaths, such as poisoning the target's food or drowning them in a toilet. The game also includes scripted opportunities that require the completion of multiple tasks. Players can eavesdrop on conversations from non-playable characters (NPCs) to obtain clues about the location and routine of targets, and uncover opportunities for creative infiltration and elimination. For example, Agent 47 can tamper with a chandelier, causing it to fall and kill a target. 47 can collect items to use as improvised weapons, access previously restricted areas, knock out NPCs, or create distractions. Completion of mission challenges, such as killing targets in unconventional ways, discovering unique items, and gaining access to new areas, enables players to progress through the mastery levels for each location, with rewards such as advanced weapons and gadgets, agency pick-up locations for stashing gear, and new starting locations for that level.",

    "text": "Each episode in the game features a sandbox-type environment the player can freely explore. Players can incapacitate specific NPCs and wear their clothes as disguises, which allow Agent 47 to access restricted areas, initiate conversations with targets or other NPCs, and perform actions that would otherwise be highly suspicious. Some NPCs, referred to as \"Enforcers\", will see through 47's disguises. Agent 47 can try to blend in to prevent this from happening. Levels can accommodate about 300 NPCs, each of which reacts to the player's actions differently and has their own unique routines. Acting strangely, such as crouching or taking cover in a crowd, will raise suspicions. If 47 tries to enter a restricted area, he may have to be frisked by guards, requiring him to discard weapons or illegal items before being searched. The artificial intelligence (AI) of NPCs has several alert phases. Guards will escort Agent 47 from a restricted area if he is found trespassing and his disguise may be compromised if a NPC sees him perform an illegal action. An alert guard will first try to arrest 47, but if he resists or tries to run, they will open fire on him. Guards can be distracted and Agent 47 can hide the bodies of incapacitated individuals and other evidence to avoid alerting other NPCs. Agent 47 can also enter Instinct Mode, which highlights the locations of the targets, as well as useful items, guards, and other important information. After eliminating his target(s), Agent 47 needs to locate an exit to complete a mission. A player's mission performance review is rated with a five-star rating system and is influenced by factors such as time elapsed, the number of non-target NPCs killed, sightings of 47 performing illegal activities, appearances on CCTV cameras , and discoveries of victims' bodies.",

According to Christian Elverdem, this goal was \"daunting\" during the early stage of the game's development because they needed to upgrade their in-house Glacier game engine to accommodate these larger maps and most of the team did not have experience building sandboxes. According to Michael Vogt, the game's lead writer, the title was designed to be a \"soft reboot\" and a \"reimagining\" of the franchise.

    "text": "The major story beats and the destinations were decided by a small group of development leads, after which a team would be responsible for each level's design, rules, targets, and other details to create a self-contained game world. The first level the team created, Paris, was the vertical slice for the game; it set the gameplay rules, general level design, and the number of non-playable characters for future episodes. According to Elverdem, every level is \"fully simulated\" and the player is free to explore and observe the behaviours of the AI. If the player eliminates a certain NPC, the simulation adjusts itself and continues to function, though it will also react to players' actions. The team listened to feedback from playtesters and adjusted the game accordingly. For instance, after some playtesters complained about the level being too punitive, the team introduced the concept of escorting, in which NPCs escort Agent 47 back to a public space if he is found trespassing, whereas in the early version, the guards would attack Agent 47.",

    "text": "The team perceived Hitman as a puzzle game with action and stealth elements; they had several major design concepts. The first concept was named \"Swiss cheese\"; according to the team, the term means players would be presented with an ample options, and there were multiple ways to move in and out of a level. Regardless of how the player chooses to infiltrate a place, the team made sure that there are no \"visual dead ends\", and that players will eventually find a new way to progress without needing to backtrack . There are two types of levels in this game; \"fortress\" refers to an area the player must infiltrate, and a \"snailhouse\" is a level that has a circular design in which players are encouraged to explore the peripheral areas to find ways to access the area in the middle of the map. The level Sapienza was developed alongside Paris and was designed as the \"opposite\" of it, both in level design layout and aesthetic. Inspired by Italy's Amalfi coast and the town of Vernazza , the maps feature a snailhouse design. Elverdem described this level as the \"pinnacle\" of the Swiss cheese design because the map has a lot of verticality and the pathways are interconnected, ensuring players will not find a dead end. According to designer Jesper Hylling, the team mainly did their location research remotely using Google Images , YouTube and Google Street View .",

    "text": "The team spent time into designing \"believable everyday life\" to ensure that players feel immersed in a level. According to the team, the team relied heavily on subtle environmental storytelling . For instance, IO's artists were instructed to write a short story for each hotel room in the Bangkok level, and tell the story using only \"set dressings\", how objects are placed in an environment, to indicate the personality or the circumstance of the room occupant. The team incorporated a concept known as \"social stealth\", in which players are expected to conform to social norms and abide by the rules in a particular setting or context to blend in. The team was inspired by sociology theories by Pierre Bourdieu , who proposed that different social spaces carry different rules, and Erving Goffman , who proposed that human behaviours will change depending on different social states and settings. Each area in a map is considered to be a microbiome that informs players the way they should act. At each level, the team balanced the proportion of public and private spaces. Players are able to freely walk around in public spaces without restrictions, which enables them to understand the \"feel\" of the level and discover mission opportunities, although there are certain public settings with implied social rules. The developers use these to teach players the basics of social stealth and the rules of trespassing without punishing players with gameplay penalties. There are two types of private spaces; professional spaces that often require a disguise and personal spaces in which the target can be alone. Private areas usually have distinct art assets to contrast them with public spaces, rewarding player's exploration and curiosity. The AI of targets displays two types of behaviour; some will roam around the map and others will station themselves in a private space that is off-limits to the player. This helped diversify the gameplay loop by encouraging different playstyles. According to the team, the first type of target encourages players to follow them and observe their behaviour and patterns while the latter type prompts players to find ways to infiltrate a setting or gain access to previously restricted areas.",

    "text": "After receiving complaints about the level being lifeless and boring from playtesters, the team introduced narrative subplots into the game with mission stories and opportunities. These elements position the players on a \"rail\" that will guide them to their target; this added additional challenges to the game's simulation because opportunities will disrupt the target's usual loop and players can complicate the loop by abandoning an ongoing opportunity in favour of another rail. Despite this complication, the team believed these subplots allow players to discover creative ways that change the AI loop in a meaningful and organic manner. For instance, if the Ether virus is destroyed in Sapienza, one of the targets, scientist Francesca DeSantis, will deviate from her core loop to visit the laboratory. Players can easily use this feature to manipulate the targets. Despite putting players on a rail, the team stopped giving players further instructions after they have gathered all of the information needed to carry out the hit. The team felt it encourages players to decide how to approach the targets and communicates to the player there is never a \"wrong\" way of killing a target.",

    "text": "Another result of the playtesting complaints was IO Interactive heavily expanding upon the tutorial missions set at the ICA Facility. The tutorial was designed to teach players the fundamentals of Hitman, how to operate the game and how to set their own goals. The first iteration was a series of individual test chambers where the player would be taught a single mechanic or feature at a time. However, even though this taught players how to operate the game, it was not representative of the nature of the game as an open sandbox. The redesigned tutorial consisted of a short 'Arrival' opening that teaches basic movement and camera controls, a 'Guided training' mission set on a sandbox yacht level and then an unguided 'Final Test' sandbox level. However, despite teaching the controls and the fundamentals of Hitman , developers still felt they had to teach players how to set their own goals so this led to the idea of the 'Freeform training' mission. In this mission players are asked to replay the yacht level from the 'Guided training' again but this time without any guidance and with more items such as remote explosives available to play with. Playtesters were given a list of challenges on paper that were deliberately designed to be simple and to work well together. This resulted in players setting their own goals and becoming creative in trying to complete all the different challenges.",

Vogt noted there was a genre change for the franchise with Hitman (2016); unlike the previous games in the series, which are crime thrillers, the 2016 game is an \"agent thriller\" that was inspired by James Bond movies such as Casino Royale and has a more \"adventurous and aspirational\" tone than the older games, which are \"cold and cynical\". The team elevated the stature of Agent 47 and his targets; 47 is now travelling to luxurious and exotic locations, and assassinating targets who are social elites and powerful criminals. Elverdem said with the genre change, Agent 47 became \"the guy you called for the most impossible hits under the most impossible circumstances\". To make the game aspirational, it has a \"stronger moral compass\" than earlier games in the series so the assassinations committed by Agent 47 are more morally justifiable and make more sense in the context of the in-game universe.",

Agent 47's only goal is to complete his assignments. Given the nature of the character, the team cannot forcefully apply typical character arcs like hero's journey for him; the team felt this would cause ludonarrative dissonance . The team introduced other characters to accompany Agent 47 through the post-2016 Hitman games. 47's handler Diana Burnwood becomes his conscience and the Shadow Client—who is revealed as Lucas Grey in Hitman 2 —serves as his emotions. These characters have genuine emotions and desires, and their actions and attitudes would slowly influence Agent 47 and facilitate his own character arc . David Bateson returned to voice Agent 47.",

    "text": "Vogt was initially concerned by the game's episodic format; he felt the episode would feel like \"a slice of an unfinished game\" if one episode features too many narrative elements. The team thus decided to include subplots within each level while the main story would slowly unfold throughout the games. This unfolding makes the game similar to a television series in which some episodes are entirely about a subplot that has no relation to the overarching narrative. Vogt said Season 1 only serves to introduce the game's characters and that the game's story would become increasingly important in later seasons. The first half of Season 1 has very little story content because the team wanted to ensure players can relate themselves to Agent 47, a merciless assassin who travels around the world to kill targets assigned to him. Because Agent 47 is a blank state character, the team strove to create a \"living, breathing\" world. Rather than a protagonist, Agent 47 is an intruder who observes and occasionally interrupts other people's lives. To achieve this, the team relied heavily on environmental storytelling. Art director Jonathan Rowe said the art team spent a lot of time \"set dressing\" every room and item to ensure each item has a reason to be there and has a tale to tell. For instance, some rooms in the Bangkok hotel are messy, communicating the story of the previous inhabitants of these rooms.",

The making of Elusive Targets did not impact the game's level design; the team used a different design philosophy compared with the main game. Players are not allowed to replay Elusive Targets because the team felt this would create a tense experience and prevent players from noticing imperfections that would make the experience less enjoyable. Elusive Targets were designed to be memorable; they do not always have connections to the main story, which gave the team more freedom to create characters that fit the setting and theme of each map. The team avoided releasing Elusive Targets in a newly released map; they wanted to give sufficient time for players to master and explore the level. The development team observed the ways players completed Elusive Targets, their play patterns and feedback, and made adjustments to make future targets more challenging. Hannes Seifert, the head of IO Interactive, described Elusive Targets as \"the pulse\" of the experience that has \"energised\" the community and boosted the game's sales. This mode was intended to provide bursts of content to the player during intervals between episodes.

It is the seventh main installment in the Hitman video game series, the sequel to 2016's Hitman and the second game in the World of Assassination trilogy. The game continues the story arc started in Hitman , following genetically engineered assassin Agent 47 as he searches for the mysterious \"Shadow Client\" who is trying to destroy Providence, a secretive organization that controls global affairs. It also explores more of 47's mysterious background, which Providence offered to bring to light in exchange for 47's assistance. Like its predecessor, the game is structured around six large sandbox locations that players can freely explore to find opportunities to eliminate their targets. It also included two online multiplayer modes called Sniper Assassin and Ghost Mode, though the game's servers for both modes have since been shut down; Sniper Assassin can still be played single-player.",

With a limited cash flow, the studio laid off nearly half of its employees and had to reduce the scope of the sequel, whose development was about 25% completed. Because the framework had been created with the previous game, development of Hitman 2 was faster than usual, taking about twenty-one months.

While preparing for game's production, in May 2017, Square Enix announced it had sold IO Interactive to concentrate resources on other studios. While Square Enix negotiated with potential buyers of the studio, IO Interactive became independent following a management buyout .

The number of players nearly tripled and a significant portion of them bought the full game, ensuring a steady revenue for the studio. Due to limited manpower, the team had to limit the scale of the sequel and many planned features were cut. Development of Hitman 2 progressed quickly due to the foundation of Hitman (2016), which was originally designed as a platform known as World of Assassination to allow the developer to add content. The late success of Hitman helped IO Interactive show there was a demand for this type of game, and the studio secured additional funding for the game's production. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment signed to publish the sequel after partnering with IO Interactive on the Definitive Edition of Hitman . The game was declared gold on 27 September 2018 after two and a half years of production with a development cost of $40 million– a significant reduction in time and cost compared to its predecessor due to the shared engine and assets.",

    "text": "The studio initially planned to include five massive maps in the game but decided to include six maps, some of which are smaller in scale. As the game was no longer episodic in structure, the team wanted the maps in the game to be more \"consistent\" in quality. The game's locations were chosen early in the game's development; each level was assigned to a \"track team\" that would be responsible for its level design, targets, and opportunities. As with the original Hitman , there are two types of levels in this game; \"fortresses\"—areas the player must infiltrate—and \"snailhouses\", levels with a circular design in which players are encouraged to explore the peripheral areas. The team visited the Maldives and Mumbai to ensure the locations in the game were authentic. According to the team, they did not intend to create an accurate version of these locations but wanted to \"evoke the smells, tastes, and sounds of these places\". One of the design principles was to ensure each map would have spaces players could familiarize themselves with while providing an element of surprise by showing operations that are typically conducted in secret. For instance, players can disguise themselves to enter areas of a bank that are off-limits to the public. IO experimented with the two established designs. For instance, player must identify an unknown civilian as the assassination target and eliminate them in a public area in Mumbai. Track teams needed to decide on the items featured in each level. Items and outfits generally are categorized as specific items used for mission stories, and items that were designed to fit each map's aesthetic. Hitman 2 added regional accents to many of its maps, such as the Mumbai and Colombia levels.",

    "text": "While Hitman served as an introductory chapter to the World of Assassination series, Hitman 2 ' s story has a more prominent role and a more structured narrative. Hitman was described as a \"white collar new money\" crime thriller whereas Hitman 2 focuses on eccentric characters and \"old money\", which were inspired by secret societies . Much of the storytelling occurs within a level and during gameplay, and cutscenes mainly serve to tie together story threads. The abandonment of the episodic release model allowed IO Interactive to present a more cohesive story because players often forgot about narrative elements while they were playing Hitman due to its sparse release schedule. Like the first game, Agent 47 is a blank-state character and the story is mostly driven by his handler Diana Burnwood and Lucas Grey, both of whom have their own emotions, motivations and goals. Their presence allows Agent 47 to gradually develop as a character and foster change. The main story was written to motivate players to eliminate the targets. Mission stories in Hitman 2 were designed to encourage players to try out new gameplay features, tools, and costumes, while providing additional story content. Developers were careful to ensure the game was hitting the right tone, recasting a more mature-sounding actor for Alma Reynard (the target from the opening New Zealand mission) and giving her a new outfit after the original take was \"too young-sounding\" in order to avoid the game becoming \"too creepy or sexually predatory\".",

    "text": "The game includes extensive dark humour ; early promotion of the game showed Agent 47 whacking NPCs with a fish. According to Markus Friedl, the game's executive producer, \"this little bit of tongue-in-cheek humor [is] very much part of the Hitman DNA\". David Bateson , who provides the voice of Agent 47, initially thought some of the dialogue was absurd but grew to appreciate it after understanding how mission stories work. According to Bateson, while Agent 47 is an expert at disguising himself, he is a terrible actor. He was instructed not to change his accent when disguised as other personalities and he delivered his lines in a \"delightfully wooden way\".",

The game did not follow its predecessor's episodic release model after the developers received negative feedback from players of the first game. Players who pre-ordered the game gained immediate access to Sniper Assassin mode. In July 2018, IO Interactive announced a competition for Sniper Assassin players; the top-three players with the highest scores would have the opportunity to have their names and likeness incorporated into the game's post-release content. Hitman 2 was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One on 13 November 2018, although those who pre-ordered the game's gold edition gained access to the game four days earlier. On 1 September 2020, IO Interactive released Hitman 2 for Google Stadia . The first level was made free-to-play on 27 February 2019.",

Sean Bean portrayed the game's first elusive target Mark Faba in the Miami map. This mission, which is titled \"The Undying\", was released on 18 November 2018, a week after the game's release. A temporary seasonal snow festival event set on the Hokkaido map from Hitman was added on 22 January 2019, later being permanently added in December that same year. A unique Halloween themed escalation called \"The Mills Reverie\" was released in October 2019.",

The homing behaviour is an intentional feature of all thrown melee items in Hitman but the speed was unusual. IO patched the game and the developers acknowledged the bug, adding a special briefcase item, the Executive Briefcase MKII, that restored the slow-homing speed. The item was released on 8 August 2019 as part of the \"Best Case Scenario\" challenge pack.",

He added the quality of the maps is more consistent than those of the first game. He said, however, Hitman 2 did not extensively experiment with the formula and that the game simply \"riffs on familiar design principles\". Writing for GameSpot , Edmon Tran described the maps as \"overwhelming in the best way possible\" and singled out Mumbai as one of the game's standout maps. Many reviewers praised the diversity of the maps, each of which is set in visually unique locations with their own characters and routes. Caty McCarthy from USgamer praised IO for perfecting the formula established in its predecessor and said all levels reached the quality of Sapienza , which is widely recognized as Hitman 's best map. Destructoid ' s Chris Carter agreed, and said \" Hitman 2 is a colossal collection of puzzles begging to be solved through multiple playthroughs\". The Legacy content received praise for introducing gameplay adjustments to older Hitman levels.",

Savage liked the gameplay enhancements but said familiar problems of the franchise had not been solved. Tran enjoyed the core gameplay loop of slowly discovering a location and its stories. While the gameplay is built on trial and error, he said the game becomes more exciting when the players' plan fails, forcing them to improvise. IGN ' s Ryan McCaffery praised the developers for allowing players to freely approach their objectives and liked the mission stories for presenting memorable and unique gameplay moments, and making successful assassinations a satisfying gameplay experience. McCarthy praised the dialogue of the mission stories, describing it as \"sharper and funnier\", and adding the script \"adds to the silly fun of the Hitman universe\". Many reviewers agreed players can only understand the intricacies of the game's system and the availability of the options presented to them by replaying it.

Brad Shoemaker, writing for Giant Bomb , found the main story surprisingly engaging; he described it as a \"taut international cat-and-mouse thriller\", and appreciated the story for raising the stakes and resolving the mysteries of the first game. He agreed, however, the game does not have the production quality of Hitman , which is evidenced by the lack of CGI cutscenes. In Hitman 2 , cinematic cut-scenes are replaced with static images and voice-overs. Writing for Game Informer , Jeff Marchiafava said the storyboard sequences are \"cheap and disappointing\", especially since the first game has lavishly produced videos and in-engine graphics.",

It is the eighth main installment in the Hitman video game series, the sequel to 2018's Hitman 2 , and the third game in the World of Assassination trilogy. Concluding the story arc started in 2016's Hitman , the game follows genetically engineered assassin Agent 47 and his allies as they hunt down the leaders of the secretive organization Providence, which controls global affairs and was partially responsible for 47's creation and upbringing. Like its two predecessors, the game is structured around six levels, five of which are large sandbox locations that players can freely explore to find opportunities to eliminate their targets. Each location presents challenges and mastery progression that players can complete to unlock items.",

It received positive reviews, with praise for its level design and atmosphere, stealth mechanics, and 47's abilities. Some critics called it the best entry in the series; the game has been called one of the greatest stealth games of all time. Hitman 3 was the most commercially successful in the series, and was extensively supported by IO with several releases of downloadable content and free updates that added features, game modes, and a location. In January 2023, IO rebranded Hitman 3 as Hitman: World of Assassination , with the contents of the previous two Hitman games becoming available to Hitman 3 owners, free of charge. Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded , a standalone expanded version of the game's VR mode, was released for Meta Quest 3 by XR Games in September 2024.",

Players will gradually discover \"persistent shortcuts\", creating pathways that can be used in future playthroughs. With the exception of the Berlin level, players are assigned several assassination targets, which can be highlighted using 47's instinct vision. Instinct vision highlights all relevant items of interest. Using stealth tactics are key to 47's success. 47 can gain access to restricted areas of the game by obtaining a disguise either by incapacitating non-player characters (NPCs) or by finding it somewhere in the map. Eavesdropping on conversations between NPCs can open up new ways for assassinations. Players may encounter several \"mission stories\" in each level, which serve as a set of guided instructions that reveal opportunities for unconventional assassinations. To avoid detection, players should avoid performing actions that would be deemed as suspicious, such as crouching or running in the open. The player's disguise may affect what actions a player may perform. For instance, dressing as a guard allows 47 to wander around the map with guns and weapons without drawing attention from other characters. Some NPCs, called enforcers, can see through the player's disguise. Guards have several states of alert level. Some may be suspicious of 47, who must attempt to blend in and mingle with the crowd to avoid drawing further attention. If the player is spotted performing an illegal action, 47 may be compromised and guards will begin searching for him. To avoid this, he must incapacitate the witnesses or change his current outfit.",

Items in the world can be picked up by 47 and used as makeshift weapons. He can use various items and gadgets to distract enemies, or assassinate targets. For instance, the ICA briefcase allows 47 to smuggle illegal weapons into an area, while the lockpick allows him to infiltrate locked areas. One addition in Hitman 3 is a camera, which can be used to scan items and relay information to 47's handler. As players complete various challenges and replay a level, approaching their targets in different ways, they earn experience points and unlock Mastery Levels, which come with unlocks of gear. Players are penalized for killing non-targets, or having crimes noticed by other NPCs or security cameras.

Players must eliminate four Syndicate leaders to complete the mode, after first eliminating the lower members of each syndicate in separate contract missions before the leaders are lured out. The player's contract, the assassination conditions, and the player's starting location are randomly generated. When a leader is lured out, a \"Showdown\" mission becomes available, and 47's handler Diana informs the player of four physical and three behavioral characteristics of the leader. Players can use their \"suspect camera\" to identify the syndicate leader in a level. Each syndicate has a unique \"syndicate type\" which rewards a particular playstyle. Completing missions earns the player Merces, which can be used to purchase weapons and gear. In each map, players can earn extra Merces by eliminating Couriers and opening safes. They can find Suppliers who sell unique Freelancer weapons. Some weapons collected in a map may be brought back to the safehouse for use in future missions. As Mastery Levels increase, 47's safehouse, which serves as a hub space for the mode, gradually expands. If the player fails a mission, 47 loses all of the equipment that he brought with him and half of his Merces reserve. Future locations become more guarded, as the syndicate members become aware of 47's presence. If the player dies or fails a Showdown mission, the player's progress is reset.",

Each area in the game was designed to be a lived-in space, big enough for players to explore and express their creativity. As with previous entries in the series, the team worked with contrasts. For instance, beneath the dark, rain-soaked streets of Chongqing lies a bright, hyper-modern research facility. Missions contrast each other. For instance, the Dubai level, which is set during the inauguration of the Scepter, the world's tallest skyscraper, is immediately followed by Dartmoor, which features a historic mansion. Game director Mattias Engström said that, whereas the Mumbai and Miami missions in Hitman 2 reached the limits of mission sizes, potentially overwhelming players, the team designed Hitman 3 with the understanding that \"it's better to be a little sharper and more focused, to create a more polished and coherent experience\". The levels in Hitman 3 are more experimental in nature, with the developer changing up the gameplay formula in certain missions ( e.g. , the Berlin level), and implementing older ideas that they had not been able to implement ( e.g., the murder-mystery in the Dartmoor level).",

Predictability and consistency were key factors for the AI, with developers wanting the game to be fun and interesting to experiment with even if it meant the AI seemed to be \"stupid\" sometimes. Scripting for the game's artificial intelligence , however, required immense effort from the team. The team had frequent meetings to discuss changing target's behaviour, and spent a significant amount of time ensuring that the system and the simulation would not break, even if the player performs unconventional actions.",

During development the team felt that the level was not living up to the \"vertigo\" and \"verticality\" keywords, and that the level would not give the player the feeling that they were high up on a massive skyscraper. As a result, the beginning of the mission was changed so that the player started outside of the skyscraper and working their way in, rather than starting by exiting an elevator into an atrium.

    "text": "Dartmoor was based around phrases like \"a house filled with secrets\", \"ominous\", and \"vulnerable\". The mansion setting was decided quite early on in development and features a gothic design inspired by detective fiction , such as Agatha Christie novels. The linear structure of a murder-mystery caused IO to rework some of the mechanics and narrative paths, as they clashed with the design principles of replayibility and player freedom. The team experimented with using randomized culprits, but struggled to build a narrative. Despite the singular, fixed story, players are required to replay the level several times to get the full picture of the incident. The player can gather evidence to accuse different characters, resulting in different outcomes. The story requires a detective disguise to allow free access to most of the level, in contrast to most Hitman levels, where the player has to avoid being detected. The first version of the mission allowed the player full freedom to explore rooms and talk to people, but the player would not know who exactly they could talk to or which rooms were relevant. The team highlighted all of the people and objects of interest, resulting in a dull experience for playtesters, who would merely follow each icon and interact with all prompts. The final version of the mission uses more subtle ways to guide players, such as through conversations between staff members and guards. Sound cues, such as a draft of wind through a room or the sound of ruffling paper, were used to hint the player in the right direction towards clues. The addition of a secondary target, where the player would be asked to eliminate the true culprit, was considered but ultimately cut.",

Instead of using tracks from other sources, Hitman 3 composer Niels Bye Nielsen wrote the music that is played at the rave. The crowd NPCs are programmed to adjust their dance moves in response to the music as it builds. Berlin features none of the guided mission stories found in other Hitman levels, and the player must identify the targets by themselves. While the team initially included a primary target, Agent Montgomery, and the other agents as optional targets, it later decided to leave the choice of targets up to the player. Initially, all 10 agents would show up in the game's instinct mode, but the team found that to be overwhelming for a first playthrough. Berlin is the first level in the trilogy to feature armed targets who will fight back instead of running into lockdown. Earlier versions of the level included agents patrolling as pairs and targets immediately pulling out their weapon to shoot Agent 47 upon spotting him; the team deemed that design too punishing. Berlin was the most expensive level to make as a result of the development of features, such as target identification and different methods of presenting information to the player.",

    "text": "The Mendoza location was IO Interactive's first attempt to depict Argentina in the Hitman franchise. The original two ideas for the level were a \"tango location set in Buenos Aires \" or a vineyard in South Africa . Both ideas were combined and Mendoza was chosen because it is an internationally known wine producing region. The company went to great lengths to create a fictional location with authentic-looking terrain and vegetation, to show the winemaking process, and to accurately portray aspects of Argentine culture, such as tango and the drinking of mate . As IO Interactive's associate producer Pablo Prada is from Argentina, he provided insight for many aspects of the level. The real-life Villavicencio Natural Reserve [ es ] was an inspiration for the architecture of the level. Professional dancers were hired for the tango animations and consulted about the music. The designers reused existing NPC Spanish-dialect dialogue, which had been recorded with Colombian and Mexican accents, rather than recording new NPC dialogue with Argentine accents , due to time and budgetary constraints, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic . The company instead chose to focus on securing appropriate voice talent for the Chongqing location.",

    "text": "Ambrose Island was added as a free downloadable content (DLC) update in 2022. The level is set during the events of Hitman 2 . Live game director Kevin Goyon said that the team wanted to create a \"pirate fantasy\" and \"to make a location that felt dangerous – but where 47 would belong\". IO wanted to explore what happened to Lucas Grey's militia after he left it during Hitman 2 . The team explored the idea of rival factions, with the militia and pirates on the island on the brink of a conflict. Goyon said that this allowed them \"to create a rich lore and interesting situations\". The island location provided a natural way to define the boundaries of the map. In contrast to other outdoor Hitman maps, which revolve around built-up areas ( e.g. , Hitman 2 ' s Santa Fortuna and Mumbai), Ambrose Island was designed around the natural rocky topology and jungles of the island, with much of the map consisting of natural environments. The topology and jungles divide the map into different zones, allowing the team to experiment with more verticality than usual on the map.",

    "text": "In Hitman 3 , the developers emphasized the game's story aspects and sought to create closure for 47's character. The game incorporates hand-crafted moments designed around the first time playthrough, with the aim being to integrate many core story moments into the gameplay. Hitman 2 established the major players, and Hitman 3 allows each of these characters to develop their own character arc and become more involved in both the story and the gameplay. Throughout all three games, Agent 47 is undergoing a period of self-discovery : learning about his past, rebuilding his relationships with other characters, and realizing his ability to exercise his free will . The Berlin level, in which 47 refuses one of his allies' advice to leave the compound and instead opts to eliminate the ICA agents sent to hunt him, was considered to be an important \"character moment\" for him, as it represents the first instance in which he must make a choice. The Mendoza level is the first time the player meets Diana face-to-face in the trilogy. At the end of the mission, 47 dances with Diana for a tango. IO chose to limit the player's outfit choices for this particular moment in order to maintain the atmosphere and not undermine the storytelling. The Carpathian Mountains level, which was controversial for its linear design, was described by Engström as a \"narratively driven set-piece that is setting up closure for the trilogy\". The train was designed as a metaphor for 47 spending his life \"following a path determined by others\", with his stepping off the train at the end being symbolic of 47 leaving his past as a contract killer behind at the end of the story. The game had a \"more mature, serious, darker\" tone when compared with Hitman 2 , which features a more lighthearted tone. The team took a more measured approach to the game's humor. While elements of lightheartedness are still core to the game's design, they are more likely to be discovered in subsequent playthroughs and are not as \"front and center\" as in Hitman 2 .",

    "text": "The game had six writers and a producer who managed the writing team. According to Forest Swartout Large, the game's executive producer, the dialogue budget accounted for a significant proportion of the overall development budget because the team had to write dialogue for not only the linear story, but also the emergent gameplay . The game's cast includes David Bateson as Agent 47, Jane Perry as Diana Burnwood, John Hopkins as Lucas Grey, Isaura Barbé-Brown as Olivia Hall, and Phillip Rosch as Arthur Edwards. For the incidental dialogue, Bateson was instructed not to diversify his accent to fit the context of the situation. Instead, he was directed to deliver dialogue in a \"delightfully wooden\" way and deliver each line, regardless of how absurd it may be, seriously. Bateson further stated that he wanted to \"give [47] almost a kind of Frankenstein's monster feel to him\". Reflecting on the evolution of dark humour across the three games, Bateson said that \"[it] has matured and evolved like a good cheese or a good wine, without the writers wanting to belittle or turn it into some kind of a lightweight comedy, because it's not. People are dying horrific deaths. But it's nice to have that dark humour\".",

Engine improvements allowed IO Interactive to use lossless LZ4 compression . The team changed their method for importing content from older titles, reducing data duplication. In November 2020, IO Interactive announced that they had teamed up with Intel to optimise Hitman 3 performance on high-end CPUs with 8+ cores, which allowed the team to include more crowds and destructible environments . They used Variable Rate Shading, a technique for improving rendering performance by dynamically changing the rate of shading in different parts of the frame.

    "text": "The idea to add a virtual reality (VR) mode originated in 2018, when a senior game designer brought his PlayStation VR headset into the office to show it off. People at the office \"couldn't stop playing\" the game Firewall: Zero Hour , which inspired the developers to make their own VR mode for Hitman 3 . The VR team, which was made up of 10 to 12 people, believed that the game's level design suited the new perspective offered by VR, even though they were not designed with it in mind. The cover system was reworked, with players physically crouching to hide out of sight instead of locking into a cover system. They enabled players to have free-form movement with the game's melee weapons, instead of using scripted animations. Many items, which previously would have been quite small on the screen or obscured by UI, were redesigned to include more detail. The team used the holographic sights for aiming in first-person. Despite VR being designed to be an immersive personal experience, the team decided not to tone down any of the violent content of the game. IO Interactive and XR Games announced Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded in June 2024, releasing it exclusively for Meta Quest 3 in September.",

Hitman 3 was released for Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , and Xbox Series X and Series S natively, Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming technology , and cloud gaming service Stadia (under the title Hitman: World of Assassination ). A VR mode was released for PlayStation VR on the same day. Full VR and motion control support for PC players became available in January 2022. Players who pre-ordered the game received the \"Trinity Pack\", which includes a collection of items inspired by the two previous games in the World of Assassination trilogy. A commemorative passport celebrating the 20th anniversary of the franchise is available for players who preordered the physical version of Hitman 3 Deluxe Edition , which was released with Limited Run Games . IO Interactive had considered returning to the episodic model for Hitman 3 like that seen in 2016's Hitman , wherein the first location would have been released in August 2020. The Hitman 3 Free Starter Pack was made available on 30 March 2021, which grants players permanent access to the ICA Facility training missions from 2016's Hitman and periodic free access to other locations from the trilogy. In September 2022, Google announced that Stadia would be shut down in January 2023. In response, IO Interactive announced that Stadia players would be able to transfer their progress to other platforms from 11 January to 17 February 2023.",

Prior to the game's launch, IO Interactive announced that unlike console players, PC players who owned Hitman or Hitman 2 on Steam would not be able to unlock locations from previous games in Hitman 3 unless they repurchased them on the Epic Games Store, backtracking on their promise. This led to criticism over IO's exclusivity deal with the Epic Games Store. Tim Sweeney , Epic Games' CEO, issued an apology and committed to working with IO Interactive on a solution to allow Steam players to import locations to the Epic Games Store. IO guaranteed that players would not need to repurchase the games, however they admitted that there would be a delay and players would not be able to import Hitman 2 locations into Hitman 3 for another few weeks. IO offered 2016's Hitman: Game of the Year Edition to players who pre-ordered or purchased the game within its first ten days of release on PC.

Upon launch, the Steam version was met with a wave of negative reviews from players who complained about the price being the same as when the game had launched on the Epic Games Store a year earlier. The pricing system was seen as confusing by some due to the large amount of different versions of the game available. In response, IO Interactive issued a statement saying that the \" Hitman 3 launch on Steam didn't go as planned\" and offered all players who had already bought the game or who purchased it through to 19 February a free upgrade to the Deluxe Edition of the game.

The sins are Greed, Pride, Sloth, Lust, Gluttony, Envy and Wrath, with the packs being released in that order. The first pack ( Greed ) was released on 30 March. The packs can be bought individually or collectively as part of a season pass . Each pack contains a unique escalation, a new suit and a new sin-themed item. The release of each pack started a new 'Season of Sin' lasting between four and six weeks, during which the regular free content such as featured contracts and elusive targets would be themed around the sin for that season. The final pack (Wrath) was released on 26 October 2021, with the \"Season of Wrath\" concluding on 29 November. While IO initially declared that they were unlikely to make new maps for the locations and instead, focused on \"reimagining\" existing locations, they released \"Ambrose Island\", a new location for free in July 2022. The Freelancer mode was originally set to be released in 2022, though its release was pushed to January 2023. Alongside Freelancer's release, IO Interactive announced that Hitman 3 would be rebranded as Hitman: World of Assassination , packaging both Hitman Game of the Year Edition and Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass into Hitman 3 . The two older Hitman games were then removed from storefronts. The Deluxe version of the game includes Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass , which allows players to gain access to the New York Bank DLC level and the Haven Island level, Hitman 3 Deluxe Edition and the Seven Deadly Sins DLC packs. Hitman: World of Assassination was released for the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025, as a launch title for the console.

He compared the game's levels to puzzles, writing that often invites players to understand its gameplay systems and exploit them in order to find success. He praised the game for allowing players to experiment with different approaches, making Hitman 3 a \"memorable and darkly comedic experience\". Edwin Evans-Thirlwell from Eurogamer wrote that Hitman 3 was most rewarding when observing the patterns of the game's systems and strategising novel plans, although he was disappointed that it does not react to the player's actions in a significant way after a target has been killed. While Jeff Cork from Game Informer liked the slow pacing and approach to level design, he felt that Hitman 3 was unlikely to convince players unimpressed with previous games. Luke Reily, writing for IGN , wrote that \"the slow-burn thrill of these games comes from planning, patience, and hiding in plain sight\", and the game \"rewards rational thinking over rushing\", while accommodating players who enjoy more action-packed games. Russ Frushtick from Polygon wrote that Hitman 3 frequently contrasted \"predictable assassin-y stuff with true nonsense\", and that the pairing of both seriousness and absurdity resulted in \"high comedy\".",

He enjoyed the openness of each level, and wrote that modern Hitman games have become hugely replayable and \"a benchmark for generous sandbox game design\". Evans-Thirlwell said that Hitman 3 ' s maps were comparable in quality to its predecessors, and said that they were worth revisiting for their diverse assassination opportunities and side stories. Hurley praised the incidental events featured, which helped flesh out the game world. Reily wrote that the maps in Hitman 3 were among the best IO had created, praising each location's complex layout and verticality and the wealth of assassination opportunities within them. Jeff Cork from Game Informer praised the levels for their consistent quality, and noted that despite the fixed gameplay loop, IO Interactive was able to introduce variety to mission design. He wrote that each level offered improvisational opportunities for players to approach their objectives. GameSpot ' s Phil Hornshaw wrote that Hitman 3 was \"full of fun and fascinating ideas\". He also said that although the gameplay mechanics were similar to the earlier games in the trilogy, the game \"finds new ways to challenge seasoned assassins purely through excellent design\". The Berlin level, which twisted the gameplay formula significantly, received critical acclaim. Jeff Grubb from VentureBeat wrote that Berlin demonstrated the \"maturity of the Hitman formula\", remarking that IO Interactive no longer need to rely on mission stories to guide players, allowing players to enjoy a freeform experience. The Dartmoor map was particularly praised for the optional murder mystery elements, drawing comparisons to the film Knives Out .

Hurley also felt that the game \"has a stronger narrative flow to locations and story beats\". Stuart, however, found the story to be forgettable and formulaic, especially in comparison with the emergent stories that the player can create on their own. He likened the game's narrative to \"straight-to- Netflix spy thrillers\". Cameron Kunzelman from Vice criticised the game for being story-driven.
